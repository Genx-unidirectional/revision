### Basic overall idea of networking

- In america the communication between big institutes has to to be done in order to exchange the research papers during war
- The ARPANET is first who developed the TCP/IP suite for information exchange.
- The internet is network of digital devices and web is nothing but lot's of devices connected via URl and form the network.
- There is server and user where interaction happens and user make request to the server in order to get the information and there are rules in order to exchange the information which is nothing but protocols.
- We have ISP(Internet Service Providers) which provides internet to user where lot's of devices are connected via internet the modem or router is used as a LAN to connect more devices and global IP address is assign to them , when they made request to the google.com the google.com actually receives the global IP address and then information is come first at the modem or router and them it pass to device which made the request but modem or router assign DHCP to each of that devices for distinction which passing the info which is done by NAT(NETWORK ACCESS TRANSLATOR) then there is port number the devices has which further identifies which application make the request.

### Port

- There are 2^16 approx 65,000 ports and 0 - 1023 are reserve
- Application reserved ports are 1024 to 49,152
- HTTP = 80
- MONGODB = 27017
- SQL = 1433

### Data transfer

- Mbps = 10^6 bits/s
- Kbps = 10^3 bits/s
- Gbps = 10^9 bits/s

### Network

- We have LAN(Local Area Network) , WAN(Wide Area network) , MAN(MetroPolitian Area Network) they together forms internet.

- SoNET : Synchronous Optical Network which uses optical wires for larger distance

- Frame relay : for LAN to connect WAN.

### Topology (how computer connected to each other)

- Bus topology
- Star topology
- Ring topology
- Tree topology
- Mesh topology

### Computer = Common Operating Machine Purposely Used For Technological Education And Research.

### OSI

- Application layer
- Session layer
- Network layer
- Computer
- Data Link layer
- Transportation layer
- Physical layer
